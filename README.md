3. **Install Dependencies and Run the Server**

   Navigate to the `server` directory, install dependencies, and start the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies and Run the Client**

   Navigate to the `client` directory, install dependencies, and start the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Visit the Application**
